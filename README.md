# mycf teas

I finally started to make the tea mod.

This mod aims to do the following:

- [ ] Implement 'pure' teas
  - [ ] White 
  - [ ] Green
  - [ ] Oolong Strip
  - [ ] Oolong Ball
  - [ ] Puerh Ripe
  - [ ] Puerh Strip
  - [ ] Black
- [ ] Implement 'Other' teas
    - [ ] Herbal 
    - [ ] Fruit
- [ ] Natural spawing of Teas
    - [ ] Procedural generation of Teas with procedural values
- [ ] Realistic processing of Teas (raw leaves -> leaves for teas)
- [ ] Items around the processing, cooking and drinking tea
- [ ] A way of naming your tea's and storing how you made them 
- [ ] Breeding of the teas to get more desirable outputs
- [ ] Make teas worthwhile to create

## Why Scala?

The Mod is bootstrapped in Java, so not additional language adapters are necessary.

I choose Scala, because I love Haskell and functional programming.
  My goal was to use typeclases and higher kinded types in this, but I won't force them into the code base.
  I also wanted to get more familiar with scala in general.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute at any point.
  Although my plans for this mode are quite set, I am still open for ideas
    and any help.
